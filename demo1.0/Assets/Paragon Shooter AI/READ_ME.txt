Thank you for buying Paragon AI!  For full documentation, please see the included manual.

Note 1:  If you want the demo scenes to work properly out-of the box,
you'll need to set your eigth physics layer to "Level Parts".  Of course,
you can always put them on whatever layer you want and modify the layermask
variables to include/exclude it as appropriate.  For more on set-up, see the manual.

NOTE 2:  Due to an error in Unity's import process, the default animation controller 
may have some of it's animations randomly swapped out for other animations in the project.
You will need to either manually open the animation controller and replace the animations
or create a new one using the included tools.  As it stands, though, the default prefabs 
may not animate properly out of the box.
